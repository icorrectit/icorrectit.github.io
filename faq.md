## Can I contribute to the list?

Of course! You can add new pages --- or modify existing ones --- via the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/icorrectit/icorrectit.github.io).

## Hey! That wasn't an error!

I'm very picky about the errors I try to correct, to minimise any unjustified accusations. However, I'm not infallible. If you think I've corrected you in error, please reply to the message including the tag **#falsepositive**.
