## *Your* and *You're*

Mistakenly using *your* instead of *you're* (or vice versa) is a common grammatical error. The confusion arises because the two words are pronounced identically. Here's how to know which word to use.

### You're

The word *you're* is a contraction --- a shortened form --- of *you are*.

{: .example}

I hope **you're** okay!
:   I hope **you are** okay!

**You're** very pretty.
:   **You are** very pretty.

Do you know where **you're** going?
:   Do you know where **you are** going?

### Your

The word *your* is possessive. It indicates ownership of something. In almost all cases, it is followed by a noun --- the thing that is owned.

{: .example}

* What's **your** name?
* Is this **your** dog?
* **Your** food is getting cold.
* I enjoyed **your** singing.

### Key points

* *You're* should only be used if it can be replaced with *you are*.
* *Your* should only be used if it can be replaced with another possessive like *his* or *her*.
