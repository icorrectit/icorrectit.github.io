## *Should/Would/Could/Must Have*

The phrase *should have* used to reflect an opinion of the speaker, usually to refer to a missed opportunity or unmet need. It is an example of the conditional perfect tense. It is often abbreviated to *should've*, along with similar forms like *could've*, *would've* and *must've*:

{: .example}

I **should've** called you.
:   I **should have** called you.

We **could've** made it on time.
:   We **could have** made it on time.

I **would've** come earlier.
:   I **would have** come earlier.

He **must've** left it at home.
:   He **must have** left it at home.

## *Shouldn't Have*

It is also possible to use negated versions of these phrases:

{: .example}

You **shouldn't've** bothered!
:   You **shouldn't have** bothered!

## Incorrect Phrases

Because of the similar pronunciation of *have* and *of*, especially when contracted as in *should've*, this is often written as *should of*:

{: .example}

* {: .incorrect} I **should of** called you.
* {: .incorrect} You **must of** left it at home.

## Key Points

* Contractions in speech can often hide the correct full version of the phrase.
* In writing, use the full phrase *should have* or the contraction *should've*.
* For the negative version, there is a double contraction, e.g. *shouldn't've*.
