## *There*, *Their* and *They're*

As with [*your* and *you're*](/your), these three words are often confused because they have the same pronunciation. Here's how to know which word to use.

### There

The word *there* has a number of different uses; as an adverb, it means "in or at that place." As a pronoun, it is the subject of an existential clause.

{: .example}

* Your watch is over **there**.
* **There** are two cups on the table.
* **There** is still hope.

### Their

The word *their* is possessive. It indicates ownership of something --- something "belonging to them."

{: .example}

* Is this **their** cat?
* They left **their** phones at home.

Although *their* usually refers to plural owners, it can also be used to refer to a singular owner of unspecified gender.

{: .example}

* Someone left **their** wallet in my car.

### They're

The word *they're* is a contraction of *they are*.

{: .example}

**They're** learning English.
:   **They are** learning English.

Do you know where **they're** going?
:   Do you know where **they are** going?

### Key points

* *There* should be used when talking about a place, or the existence of something. (Compare with *here*.)
* *Their* should only be used if it can be replaced with another possessive like *his* or *her*.
* *They're* should only be used if it can be replaced with *they are*.
